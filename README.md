### API KEYS
You'll also need an API Key in order for the code to work.
You can get one here for free : [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) 

### VPN
If you're located in countries that dont't yet allow the use of google gemini for developers (as France), you'll need a VPN. 
TunnelBear's free plan is perfect for that to my opinion, get it using this link : [www.tunnelbear.com](www.tunnelbear.com)
